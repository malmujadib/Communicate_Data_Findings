# (Ford GoBike System Data Exploration)
## by (Mohammed Al Mujadib)


## Dataset

> I have used Ford GoBike Dataset, which are a dataset contains data about bike-racing attributes for approximately 183412 bike.


## Summary of Findings

> 1- It looks like most of the racers have finished the race in between 200 Seconds to 1000 Seconds. 

> 2- It is the same for the start/end_station_latitude and the most frequent latitude is between 37.7 and 37.8 .

> 3- It seems that the end and start station longitude is similar, and the most frequent longitude is between (-122.6, -122.4) for the start as will as the end. 

> 4- I compared two type of users: Subscriber and Customer, in this dataset we have more than 140000 subsrcibers with 89.46% and almost 20000 customers with 10.54%.

> 5- Most racers start at Market St at 10th St.

> 6- It is looks like the Subscribers often finish the race faster than the Customers. 

> 7- fastest way to finish the race if you latitude between 37.76 and 37.86 

> 8- Fastest way to finish the race if you longitude between -122.46 and -122.23 . 

> 9- the most frequent latitude and longitude is between (37.76) and (37.80) for the latitude, (-122.45) and (-122.40) for the longitude.

> 10- Most of the Subscribers finished the race faster than the Customers, and the most frequent latitude for the Subscribers is 132, and for the the Customers is 155.

> 11- Most of the Subscribers finished the race faster than the Customers, and the most frequent longitude for the Subscribers is between 275 and 290, and for the the Customers is between 215 and 230 .


## Key Insights for Presentation

> This presentation shows the most user type, who of these users will finish the trip faster, and why the finish it faster:

> 1- the most user type we have is the Subscribers. 

> 2- subsrcibers is faster than the Customers.

> 3- the most frequent latitude for the Subscribers is 132, and for the the Customers is 155,so that why the subscribers is faster than the customers. 

> 4- Most of the Subscribers finished the race faster than the Customers, and the most frequent longitude for the Subscribers is between 275 and 290, and for the the Customers is between 215 and 230 .
